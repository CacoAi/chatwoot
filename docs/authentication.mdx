# Authentication

All API requests to Chatwoot require authentication. Chatwoot uses API access tokens for authentication.

## API Access Tokens

### User API Access Token

This token can be obtained from your profile page in the Chatwoot dashboard. It provides access to endpoints based on your user permission levels.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.chatwoot.com/api/v1/profile" \
  -H "api_access_token: your_api_access_token"
```

### Agent Bot API Access Token

This token should be provided by a system admin or obtained via the Rails console. It can be used to build bot integrations and can only access limited APIs.

### Platform App API Access Token

This token can be obtained by the system admin after creating a platform app. It should be used to provision agent bots, accounts, users, and their roles.

## Adding Authentication to Requests

Include your API access token in the request header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://app.chatwoot.com/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/inboxes" \
  -H "api_access_token: your_api_access_token"
```

## Security Best Practices

- Keep your API access tokens secure
- Rotate your tokens periodically
- Use HTTPS for all API requests
- Only grant the minimum required permissions
- Don't expose tokens in client-side code
