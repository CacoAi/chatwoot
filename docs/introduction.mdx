# Introduction to Chatwoot API

Chatwoot provides comprehensive API endpoints to manage and integrate with all aspects of the platform. Use these APIs to create custom integrations, automate workflows, and build on top of Chatwoot.

## Getting Started

To use the Chatwoot API, you'll need:

1. A Chatwoot account
2. An API access token (obtained from your profile page)
3. Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and HTTP requests

## API Organization

Our APIs are organized into several logical groups:

- **Platform API** - For managing platform-level resources like accounts, users, and agent bots
- **Application API** - For working with application-level resources like contacts, conversations, and inboxes
- **Client API** - For client applications to interact with Chatwoot
- **Other APIs** - Additional functionality like CSAT surveys

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. See the [Authentication](/authentication) section for details.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting. Please implement appropriate retry logic in your applications.
